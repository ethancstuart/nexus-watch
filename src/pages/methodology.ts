      <h1 class="method-title">How NexusWatch scores risk</h1>
      <p class="method-lede">Data sources, trust layer, and verification methodology behind every CII score.</p>

      <h2 class="brief-section-header">The Trust Layer</h2>
      <p>Every NexusWatch number is <strong>auditable</strong>. Every call carries the criterion it was issued with, the source that resolves it and the evidence that source returned, and the whole book is downloadable as JSON from <code>/api/calls/ledger</code>. Where a published verdict has since been contradicted by better evidence, the correction is shown beside it rather than replacing it.</p>
      <ul class="method-list">
        <li><strong>Confidence levels</strong> (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) based on source count, freshness, and data volume</li>
        <li><strong>Verification badges</strong> — events are CONFIRMED (3+ sources), CORROBORATED (2), UNVERIFIED (1), or CONTESTED</li>
        <li><strong>Explicit data gaps</strong> — we show you what we DON'T have, not just what we do</li>
        <li><strong>Source freshness</strong> — live/recent/stale/offline indicators on every feed</li>
        <li><strong>The Ledger</strong> — every dated, falsifiable call, resolved against external sources, at <a class="method-link" href="#/ledger">/ledger</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="brief-section-header">How the Ledger forecasts — and what the first score can show</h2>
      <p><em>Published 2026-08-28, before the first calls resolve on 5 September. We are stating this
      ahead of the number rather than after it, because after a bad number the same paragraph would
      read as an excuse.</em></p>
      <p>Each call's probability is that country's own long-run rate, re-weighted toward its recent
      behaviour. The base rate we score against is <strong>that same long-run rate</strong>. The
      forecast and the baseline are therefore two summaries of one series, and the honest description
      of what the first cohort measures is narrower than "the world, graded":
      <strong>does weighting recent behaviour beat the long-run average?</strong></p>
      <p>That is a real and answerable question, and as far as we know nobody publishes the answer.
      But it is not a claim to understand geopolitics, and we would rather say so ourselves than have
      a careful reader say it for us. A negative score means recency weighting did not help — a valid
      result we expect to publish in the same size type as any other.</p>
      <p>It is also why the Ledger <strong>withholds any skill number until three independent
      resolution batches exist</strong>. One fortnight cannot separate a forecasting method from the
      weather it happened to land in, and 39 calls issued on one day against one data source are far
      fewer independent observations than 39.</p>
      <p>What changes next: we are building a forecast input that is genuinely independent of the
      base-rate series — election and referendum dates, sanctions designations, conflict deltas — so
      that a future version of this number measures something about the world rather than about our
      own choice of window. That work is dated and will be described here when it ships.</p>

      <h2 class="brief-section-header">When a call cannot be resolved</h2>
      <p><em>Published 2026-08-28, before this rule was applied to any call. Amended 2026-08-30,
      before the first resolution, to state the threshold the resolver actually uses.</em></p>
      <p>A call is resolved by counting qualifying events at an external source inside a window fixed
      before the outcome was known. Sometimes we did not look hard enough at that country, in that
      window, to be entitled to an answer either way.</p>
      <p><strong>Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and we will not score it as a miss.</strong>
      Before a censorship call can be scored as a miss, the window has to clear two bars — days and
      volume, because either alone can be passed by a window nobody really watched:</p>
      <ul class="method-list">
        <li><strong>Days.</strong> OONI must have observed the country on at least <strong>half the
        days</strong> in the call&rsquo;s window, rounded up. For a fourteen-day call that is
        <strong>${cov14.minDays} days</strong>. A single busy day cannot certify a fortnight.</li>
        <li><strong>Volume.</strong> At least <strong>${MIN_MEASUREMENTS_PER_REQUIRED_DAY}
        measurements per required day</strong> &mdash; <strong>${cov14.minMeasurements} measurements</strong>
        across a fourteen-day call. This number is a judgement and we state it as one: below roughly
        fifty measurements a country-day is one or two probes, and one volunteer&rsquo;s network
        conditions should not decide a public verdict. It is not tuned to a publishing count.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Both bars are <em>derived from the window the call declared</em>, not held in a list, so a
      future call with a different horizon is governed by construction rather than because somebody
      remembered to extend a table. The figures above are read from the same module the resolver
      runs on; this page cannot state a threshold the resolver is not using.</p>
      <p><strong>The rule cuts one way only.</strong> A confirmed block we <em>did</em> observe
      resolves the call as a <strong>hit</strong> no matter how thin the coverage &mdash; seeing
      something happen is evidence that it happened. It is the <em>absence</em> of a block that needs
      a well-observed window to mean anything. Coverage is queried only on the way to a miss.</p>
      <p>Below the line, the call is not scored:</p>
      <ul class="method-list">
        <li>It stays <code>pending</code> while late evidence could still arrive. OONI&rsquo;s ingest
        lags roughly a day and our collector fetches only the previous day, so a backfill or a
        collector fix is a real possibility, not a formality.</li>
        <li>If the coverage has still not appeared <strong>7 days after the resolution date</strong>,
        the call is marked <code>unresolvable</code> with the reason recorded in the row, and it is
        <strong>excluded from every number we publish</strong>.</li>
        <li>Unresolvable calls stay visible on the Ledger with their reason, counted in their own
        column beside hits and misses. A withdrawn call that vanishes is indistinguishable from a
        moved goalpost, so nothing is ever deleted.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Unresolvable is not the same as void.</strong> A call is <em>void</em> when our own
      criterion was unsound &mdash; our mistake, withdrawn by us. It is <em>unresolvable</em> when the
      world did not supply enough evidence to judge either way. Neither is ever scored.</p>
      <p>The distinction that matters: this rule fires on how much the
      <em>resolver</em> saw, never on whether we liked the answer. Coverage is counted from OONI&rsquo;s
      own measurement volume, which we neither produce nor influence, and the window was fixed when
      the call was made. A call heading for a miss in a <em>well-observed</em> country cannot be
      withheld by it &mdash; that call is scored as a miss.</p>
      <p><strong>But we should state the asymmetry rather than let you find it.</strong> Because the
      gate governs only the would-be miss, it can remove misses from the record and can never remove a
      hit. That is deliberate &mdash; a block we observed is evidence regardless of how thin the
      window was, while the absence of a block means nothing unless we looked &mdash; and it is still
      an asymmetry. So the unresolvable calls stay on the Ledger, in their own column, with the days
      and measurement counts that put them there, and the count is published beside every result. A
      rule that quietly deleted its own inconvenient cases would be indistinguishable from this one
      if we did not show you the cases.</p>
      <p><strong>And the uncomfortable part, which belongs here permanently.</strong> OONI is a
      volunteer network, and its coverage is thinnest in precisely the places where running a
      measurement tool is most dangerous &mdash; the Sahel and the Horn. Our coverage is
      <em>anti-correlated</em> with the thing we are trying to measure: the countries we most want to
      be right about are the ones we have least evidence for. That is a property of the instrument,
      not a gap we can close by tuning a threshold, and no number on this site should be read without
      it. The count of calls currently expected to be unresolvable, and the countries, are recomputed
      live on <a href="#/ledger">the Ledger</a> rather than stated here, because a number written into
      a page is only true on the day it is typed.</p>

      <h2 class="brief-section-header">What is CII?</h2>
      <p>As of <strong>2026-08-23</strong> the Country Instability Index is <strong>two numbers, never one sum</strong>:</p>
      <ul class="method-list">
        <li><strong>The structural level (0–100)</strong> — conflict, governance and market-exposure baselines, reviewed and vintage-dated. It changes when the baselines are reviewed, not daily. Bands: ≥80 severe, 60–79 elevated, 40–59 mixed, &lt;40 stable.</li>
        <li><strong>The daily deviation (points)</strong> — today's live signal on top of the level: earthquakes (USGS), confirmed censorship (OONI), FX stress, attention spikes (Wikipedia). 0 is a quiet day, and it mean-reverts by construction as rolling feeds age out.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Why the split: measured over 90 days of our own history, the conflict component moved in <strong>0 of 85 countries</strong>, governance in 7 and market exposure in 16 — those were a slow baseline wearing a live label — while the old "sentiment" component was defined as conflict×0.5 + disasters×0.3, an echo of other components that double-counted both. Summing a static level with mean-reverting live noise produced daily "moves" that were mostly a rolling 24-hour feed aging out. Publishing the two parts separately is the honest version of the same information.</p>
      <p>NexusWatch keeps <strong>scored daily history for 85 countries</strong> — the set every forecast, snapshot and ledger call runs on.</p>
      <p>The index feeds the daily brief. The map, the correlation engine, the scenario simulator and the portfolio calculator this paragraph used to list were deleted in September 2026.</p>

      <h2 class="brief-section-header">Data sources (7)</h2>
      <p>
        This list was wrong until 2026-09-12. It named twelve sources, nine of which had no collector in the
        codebase — they were left behind when the map product was deleted, and the refresh intervals beside them
        described nothing that was running. On a page whose only job is to let you check our work, that was the
        worst error on the site. These seven are what the code actually reads, at the cadence it actually reads
        them.
      </p>
      <ul class="method-list">
        <li><strong>OONI</strong> — Open Observatory of Network Interference, <code>web_connectivity</code> measurements at day grain. Collected every six hours; resolves every censorship call. Data is licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.</li>
        <li><strong>Exchange-rate reference rates</strong> — daily USD reference rates, collected at 05:00 UTC. Resolves every FX call.</li>
        <li><strong>USGS</strong> — earthquake catalogue, queried directly at resolution time rather than collected. Resolves the seismicity calibration calls.</li>
        <li><strong>UCDP</strong> — Uppsala Conflict Data Program georeferenced events, monthly candidate files plus annual curated releases (~1 month lag). Drives the derived conflict baseline.</li>
        <li><strong>OFAC and the UN consolidated list</strong> — sanctions designations, collected every six hours.</li>
        <li><strong>World Bank governance indicators</strong> — refreshed monthly.</li>
        <li><strong>Wikipedia pageviews</strong> — daily, as an attention signal.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Nothing else is read. ACLED, GDELT, NASA FIRMS, WHO, Open-Meteo, OpenSky, AIS, Polymarket, Cloudflare
        Radar and UNHCR appeared on this page for months after their collectors were deleted. They are not
        inputs and have not been for some time.
      </p>

      <h2 class="brief-section-header">The Components</h2>
      <p>The <strong>structural level</strong> is the rescaled sum of Conflict + Governance + Market Exposure (55 native points → 0–100). The <strong>daily deviation</strong> is the sum of Disasters + Infrastructure/Censorship + Attention + FX stress, reported in raw points. The two are never added together:</p>

The derived side is what caught Mexico sitting at a hand-set zero with ~3,100 cartel-war deaths a year.
