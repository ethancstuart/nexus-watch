 * 0.6*cii + 0.4*(cii + delta7) measured against the cii — the system marking
 * its own homework, at -37.3% skill against a naive no-change baseline. Every
 * number below comes from calls resolved against something outside NexusWatch:
 * OONI blocking measurements and daily FX reference rates.
 *
 * Reports skill EVEN WHEN NEGATIVE. A ledger that only publishes its wins is
 * not a ledger, and "the naive baseline is beating us" is a real result in a
