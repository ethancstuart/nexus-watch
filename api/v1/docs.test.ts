/**
 * THE PUBLIC API DOCS MUST NOT DESCRIBE THINGS THAT DO NOT EXIST.
 *
 * Until 2026-08-30 this endpoint published four claims, none of them true:
 * a $99/month tier, a $249/month tier, a per-tier rate limit on all twelve
 * endpoints, and Bearer-token authentication. Stripe was in test mode, the
 * api_keys table was empty, no v1 handler called rateLimit() or read an
 * Authorization header, and 15 requests in a few seconds returned 15x200.
 *
 * Rule 6: when a claim can only be met by inventing something, the honest
 * output is the gap. These assertions keep it that way.
 *
 * THE RATE-LIMIT CHECK IS DERIVED, not a list. It reads the endpoints out of
 * the published payload and looks for enforcement in the handler each one
 * names, so a NEW endpoint that advertises a limit it does not enforce fails
 * by default rather than passing because nobody added it here.
