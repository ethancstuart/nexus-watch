 * Record today's calls (daily, 09:30 UTC — before the brief at 10:00).
 *
 * A call is a dated, falsifiable claim about something OUTSIDE NexusWatch,
 * written down before the outcome is known. That is the whole distinction from
 * `record-assessments.ts`, which predicts our own CII from our own CII and is
 * therefore unfalsifiable no matter how many rows it writes (measured skill
 * against a no-change baseline: −37.3%).
 *
 * THE FORECAST, stated plainly so it can be argued with: a country's chance of
 * a confirmed censorship event in the next 14 days is a blend of its recent
 * rate and its long-run rate, leaning recent. That is a real claim about the
 * domain — that recent activity predicts near-term activity — and it is exactly
 * the kind of claim that can lose. If it has no predictive power the Brier
 * skill score against the long-run base rate comes out at or below zero, and
 * that number gets published as it falls out. A model too complicated to be
 * legibly wrong would be worse here, not better.
 *
 * Idempotent: `calls_unique_daily` means re-running on the same day updates the
 * existing row rather than duplicating it.
