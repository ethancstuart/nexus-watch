 * measured move (e.g. "1.12") into evidence_count and threw
 * `invalid input syntax for type integer` on SIXTY-THREE of sixty-six calls.
 * The three that "resolved" were the ones whose move happened to round to a
 * whole number. Every failure was caught by the per-call isolation, counted
 * in `errored`, reported in a response body nobody reads, and the run said
 * ok:true. Resolution day two, and the machine was broken in a way that
 * looked exactly like working.
 *
 *   censorship_event  → days with a confirmed block   (integer, natural)
 *   fx_devaluation    → peak depreciation in BASIS POINTS (integer, exact:
 *                       1.12% → 112; no float ever meets the column)
 *   seismicity_window → qualifying USGS events        (integer, natural)
 *
 * Display code renders each kind in its own units (api/call.ts).
