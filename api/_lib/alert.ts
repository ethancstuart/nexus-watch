/**
 * The alarm bell — one place, and it reaches a person with what is already
 * configured.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every monitoring component in this repo posted to
 * `DISCORD_APPROVAL_WEBHOOK_URL`, and that variable has never been set in
 * production — verified 2026-08-28 against `vercel env ls`. So `cron-health`
 * silently no-opped, and the outcome was exactly what this project's own
 * governance predicts: a delivery channel failed for 41 consecutive days,
 * writing a `failed` row every single morning, and nobody found out until a
 * human ran a query by hand.
 *
 * A check whose result does not reach a person is a log line. So the alarm no
 * longer depends on a channel that was never wired: it prefers Discord when a
 * webhook exists, and otherwise sends email through Resend to ADMIN_EMAILS —
 * both of which ARE configured in production today. Nothing to set up, which
 * is the point; a monitoring plan gated on a five-minute task nobody does is
 * a monitoring plan that does not exist.
 *
 * It returns which channel carried the alert so callers can report honestly
 * rather than assume delivery.
