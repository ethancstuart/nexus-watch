/**
 * The Call Ledger — dated, falsifiable predictions scored against EXTERNAL
 * ground truth.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `api/cron/record-assessments.ts:85` generates every
 * "prediction" as `0.6·score + 0.4·(score + Δ7)` — a mechanical extrapolation
 * of the CII — and then scores it against the CII. The system forecasts its own
 * output. Measured 2026-08-22, that pipeline's skill against a naive no-change
 * baseline is **−37.3%** (MAE 1.263 vs 0.920 over 10,215 scored rows): worse
 * than assuming nothing changes, on a series that mostly does not change. It is
 * a closed loop, and a closed loop cannot be a track record no matter how many
 * rows it accumulates.
 *
 * A call in this module is different in one specific way: **nothing about its
 * resolution touches NexusWatch's own numbers.** A call names an external
 * source, a threshold and a date before the fact, and something outside this
 * system decides whether it happened.
 *
 * ONE RESOLVER IS LIVE TODAY, and the reason the other is not is worth
 * recording, because its row count is misleading:
 *
 *   - `censorship_event` → `ooni_measurements`. LIVE. 39 countries, daily
 *     since 2026-04-18, 4-6 confirmed blocking events a day. Confirmed
 *     blocking is among the most reliable open leading indicators of a
 *     political crackdown, and it is a genuine per-country time series.
 *
 *   - `sanctions_designation` → `sanctions_events`. NOT USABLE YET. The table
 *     holds 115,706 rows, which looks like the richest political dataset here
 *     and is not: it is 1,021 distinct entities re-inserted ~113 times. The
 *     collector's `ON CONFLICT (source, source_entity_id, change_type,
 *     source_date)` never fires, so the same snapshot is re-added daily as
 *     `change_type = 'add'` — 115,706 of 115,706 rows are 'add', which is not
 *     what a diff produces. Worse for our purposes, `country_codes` is EMPTY on
 *     every single row, so nothing in it can resolve a country-scoped claim.
 *     Fix api/cron/source-ofac.ts first; the kind goes in then.
 *
 *   - `fx_devaluation` → `fx_rates`. LIVE. 80 currencies mapped to 80
 *     countries, daily and unbroken since 2026-04-18. A market price is the
 *     best resolver material there is: it settles itself, on a fixed date,
 *     with no threshold anyone can argue about afterwards. It is not a closed
 *     loop — a market price is emphatically not our output.
 *
 * The censorship resolver is political on purpose: the brief measures 3.1%
 * politics against 18.5% seismic, and censorship is the highest-frequency
 * political signal actually flowing. FX adds an independent second domain, so
 * the aggregate score is not one narrow signal wearing a track record's
 * clothes.
 *
 * SCORING. Brier score, plus the Murphy decomposition into reliability,
 * resolution and uncertainty, plus skill against the base rate. The base rate
 * is the honest baseline here — "how often does this happen anyway" — and a
 * forecaster that cannot beat it has demonstrated nothing. Publishing the skill
 * score when it is negative is the point of the exercise, not a failure of it.

 *   FX skill vs its own climatology: +0.9% at w=0.2, +0.8% at w=0.4,
 *   and -0.3% at w=0.6 — past 0.4 the blend is worse than not blending.
 *
 * SUPERSEDED, kept because a quietly replaced measurement teaches nobody —
 * the 2026-08-23 run, on less than half the folds:
 *
 *     w      FX (n=267)   censorship (n=93)
 *     0.0    0.1013       0.0677
 *     0.2    0.0993       0.0687
 *     0.4    0.0987 <- best for FX, and why the weight was 0.4
 *     0.6    0.0994       0.0725   <- the original default
 *     0.8    0.1014       0.0753
 *
 * THE ABSOLUTES MOVED AND THE SHAPE DID NOT. Reference Brier went from ~0.10
 * to 0.18 and the FX hit rate from 7.5% to 23.2%: the calm window that trained
 * the first run has ended, so the older absolutes describe a regime that is
 * gone. The ordering survived both runs — a little recency helps FX, any
 * recency hurts censorship — which is the part the weight is set from.
 *
 * FX moved 0.4 -> 0.2 on 2026-09-21 to sit on the measured optimum. The
 * difference from 0.4 is +0.1pp of skill and is inside the noise; it is made
 * because the rule is that the weight follows the backtest, and 0.6 was
 * proposed on a +6.0% figure that this script does not reproduce at any
 * weight. It measures -0.3% there.
 *
 * Recency carries a small real signal in FX and none at all in censorship —
 * at w=0.6 the censorship leg scored -7.1% skill against its own climatology
 * on the first run and -14.1% on this one, a pure noise penalty the
 * data-science review predicted from the variance of a three-window
 * estimator. So censorship states climatology, and FX leans recent only as
 * far as the evidence supports.
 *
 * Remeasure as history accumulates; the weight follows the backtest, never
 * the other way around.
