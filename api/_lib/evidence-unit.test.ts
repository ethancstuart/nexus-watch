/**
 * THE CENSORSHIP THRESHOLD MEANS "DAYS", AND ONLY BECAUSE OF THE COLLECTOR.
 *
 * `resolve-calls.ts` counts censorship evidence as
 * `COUNT(DISTINCT measurement_date)` — blocked DAYS. Every censorship call on
 * the book carries `threshold = 1`, and the claim text says "at least N
 * confirmed blocking events", so days and events must not silently diverge.
 *
 * Today they cannot: `ooni_measurements` is keyed
 * (country_code, test_name, measurement_date) and the collector requests
 * exactly ONE test_name, so there is at most one row per country-day. Verified
 * against production 2026-08-29: for confirmed_blocked > 0, COUNT(*) = 742 and
 * COUNT(DISTINCT (country_code, measurement_date)) = 742, across 1 test_name.
 *
 * An independent review flagged the count change as a silent semantic shift,
 * and it was right that nothing enforced the assumption — the equivalence was
 * true, measured, and completely unguarded. A measurement in a commit message
 * protects nothing; the day someone adds `whatsapp` or `telegram` to the
 * collector (which its own docstring promises), rows-per-country-day becomes
 * 2 or 3 and every threshold in the book would quietly multiply.
 *
 * So the guard lives at the ASSUMPTION, not at the arithmetic: if the collector
 * stops being single-test, this fails and names the resolver that depends on
 * it. Derived from what the collector actually requests, so a new test added by
 * anyone fails by default rather than passing by omission.
