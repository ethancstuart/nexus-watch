/**
 * The brief's section structure — one source of truth, prompt and gate alike.

 * Owner decision 2026-08-23: restructure the brief around the accountability
 * loop — The Ledger (mechanical, inserted after the H1 by the template) →
 * Today's Call → Top Signal → The Board (with a mandatory "what would change
 * our mind" clause) → What We're Not Saying → The Long Fuse. Scenario
 * Spotlight is killed: an unfalsifiable hypothetical actively undermines a
 * graded product.
 *
 * The prompt builds its STRUCTURE block from these constants and the publish
 * gate validates the draft against the same constants, so the two cannot
 * drift apart (rule 5: derive, don't enumerate twice). A draft that invents,
 * drops, or reorders sections fails the gate and the deterministic fallback
 * publishes instead.

/**
 * SUBJECT LINES — declared, not scraped.
 *
 * The first implementation extracted the opening **bold** phrase of Top
 * Signal. A bold marker is EMPHASIS, not a title, so what shipped was
 * whatever the model happened to embolden first:
 *
 *   2026-08-24  "Thailand"                                (8 chars)
 *   2026-08-25  "Thailand"                                (8)
 *   2026-08-26  "Why it matters"                          (14 — a transition phrase)
 *   2026-08-27  "Thailand censorship by 2026-09-05"       (33)
 *   2026-08-28  "OFAC designated Palestine Action and …"  (76 — truncates on a phone)
 *
 * The fix is not a better regex. It is to stop reading a side-effect and ask
 * for the thing we actually want: the prompt now requires a `SUBJECT:` line,
 * which is parsed out, validated against a floor, and stripped before the
 * gates or the reader ever see it. Scraped extraction survives only as the
 * fallback for a draft that omits the line, and the dated form as the last
 * resort — a missing subject must never block delivery.
