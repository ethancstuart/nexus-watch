/**
 * Server-rendered /ledger.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE src/pages/ledger.ts. The SPA renders the ledger
 * beautifully and a crawler sees none of it: /ledger returns index.html with the
 * generic site title and no content, because every route in this app is
 * client-rendered. The ledger is the one page the whole repositioning depends on
 * being findable — "the only geopolitical platform that publishes its own track
 * record" is worth nothing if the record is invisible to search.
 *
 * Both paths coexist the way /brief/:date already does: an in-app navigation
 * pushState's and the SPA renders, while a direct load or a crawl hits this
 * function and gets real HTML with no JavaScript required.
 *
 * THE PALETTE COMES FROM src/styles/email-tokens.ts, the same source the daily
 * brief and the dossier theme read. A server renderer that cannot use CSS custom
 * properties is exactly where a private copy of the palette gets made, and a
 * private copy is how an identity change strands the most public surface you
 * have. There are no colour literals below.
