    //     branch's own tree rather than into whatever is checked out. Those
    //     snapshots are never cleaned up, so they accumulate: on 2026-09-21
    //     eighteen of them held 436 test files against the working tree's 44,
    //     and `npx vitest run` reported "5461 tests passed" for a suite of
    //     498. Ninety percent of every local verification was other branches.
    //
    // The failure mode is the same for both and it is worse than a wrong
    // number. `.codex-reviews/` is gitignored, so CI never sees it: CI ran 44
    // files while local ran 480, and the two disagreed about what "the tests"
    // means. A stale snapshot pinned to an older commit can also fail the
    // suite for code this branch does not contain, or pass and pad the count
    // so a shrinking real suite looks healthy.
