/**
 * No NEW hex colour literals outside the two token sources.
 *
 * WHY. `docs/design-system.md` rule 2 — "no new hex literals in component CSS;
 * if you reach for one, the palette is missing a semantic name" — has been the
 * written rule since the design system was drafted, and nothing has ever
 * enforced it. What that costs is on this branch's own record: the
 * single-identity commit had to reclaim `index.html` and
 * `public/site.webmanifest` by hand, because both carried `#04050a` and
 * `#ff6600` — colours that appeared in NO token file — on two surfaces no
 * `src/` scan reaches. `api/brief/screenshot.ts` held a sixth private copy of
 * the palette and said so in a comment. A private copy of a colour is how an
 * identity change strands a public surface, which is the failure rule 8 exists
 * for; this is that rule with an exit code.
 *
 * WHY A RATCHET AND NOT A BAN. 224 literals survive across 29 files the day
 * this lands. The retired terminal orange `#ff6600` alone appears 39 times on
 * a branch whose whole premise is that the terminal identity is gone — still
 * the most common literal in the tree, ahead of the dossier's own oxblood at
 * 12. A guard that fails 302 times on arrival is a guard someone switches off,
 * and the lesson already written into `.githooks/pre-push` is that friction
 * gets skipped rather than paid. So the SCOPE is derived and only the DEBT is
 * enumerated. The 117 files that are clean today are pinned at empty, a file
 * that does not exist yet is pinned at empty, and each dirty file is pinned at
 * exactly the colours it holds.
 *
 * THE PIN IS THE MULTISET, NOT A COUNT, and it matches exactly in both
 * directions. `'14×#ff6600 6×#e0e0e0'` says which colours are stranded where,
 * so BASELINE reads as an inventory of the identity debt rather than as a
 * column of numbers. A count alone would let a file swap one literal for a
 * different one at the same total and pass — an independent review named that
 * hole twice, and pinning the values closes it. Removing a literal fails too,
 * with the corrected line printed ready to paste: a budget only ever checked
 * upward is the ceiling nobody lowers, which is how three enumerated guard
 * lists in this repo were found stale on 2026-08-30, two of them silently.
 *
 * WHY THE SCOPE IS WIDER THAN IT FIRST WAS, TWICE. The first version walked
 * `src/` and `api/` and then NAMED `index.html` and `public/site.webmanifest`
 * as two known "unreachable surfaces". An independent review blocked it for
 * exactly that: naming the two files that had already burned us leaves a third
 * to pass by omission, which is the enumerate-don't-derive failure this repo
 * has legislated against, committed inside a guard whose own subject is
 * deriving. The second version replaced them with a walk of `public/` and a
 * derived root-document rule, and the same review blocked it again for the
 * extension allowlist underneath — a new served file type would still pass by
 * omission. So membership is now decided by CONTENT: every file under the
 * served roots that is text is in scope, and binaries fall out because they
 * hold a NUL byte. Measured when it changed: four files joined the scan
 * (`api/.gitkeep`, `api/tsconfig.json`, `api/_fonts/README.md`,
 * `public/robots.txt`) and all four are clean, so the widening cost nothing.
 *
 * WHAT WIDENING IT FOUND. `public/icons/icon-192.svg` and `icon-512.svg` are a
 * `#0a0a0a` tile with an `#ff6600` "NW" set in Courier New — the whole retired
 * terminal identity, font included. `index.html:6` points the browser tab at
 * one and `index.html:100` gives the other as the JSON-LD organisation logo,
 * and the manifest lists both for the install prompt. B1 reclaimed the two
 * files that POINT at these icons and not the icons themselves.
 *
 * WHERE THE DERIVATION STOPS, AND WHY IT STOPS THERE. A third review round
 * blocked this again for naming `src`, `api` and `public` at all. That
 * objection has a limit: no guard can define its universe without naming
 * something, and the only alternative — walk the whole repo — means
 * enumerating EXCLUSIONS instead. `docs/` alone holds 391 literals in
 * generated Lighthouse reports, `ledger-snapshots/` holds sixteen 300 KB
 * fixtures, and this guard's own test file asserts colours on purpose. That is
 * the same list wearing the opposite sign, and a longer one.
 *
 * These three roots are not a list of places colour has been found. They are
 * the deployment contract: Vite builds `index.html` plus `src/` and copies
 * `public/` verbatim, Vercel runs `api/`, and nothing else reaches a browser.
 * A fourth served root cannot appear without an edit to `vite.config.ts` or
 * `vercel.json`. The residual is that such an edit lands and nobody updates
 * this line — stated here rather than defended against, because defending
 * against it means parsing the build config to learn what the build config
 * says.
 *
 * WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT PROVE. It reads text, so a colour computed at runtime
 * (`'#' + code`) or held in a database row is invisible to it. It says nothing
 * about whether a pinned literal is the RIGHT colour — only that the set has
 * not changed behind anyone's back. And a `//` INSIDE a TypeScript string is
 * read as the start of a comment, so a literal after one on the same line
 * would be masked away: measured at zero instances across 122 script files,
 * and a quote-parity heuristic was rejected because `const s = "it's"; //
 * #ff6600` would then be charged for a comment — trading a blind spot with no
 * instances for a false positive with several.
 *
 * Usage: npx tsx scripts/check-hex-literals.ts
