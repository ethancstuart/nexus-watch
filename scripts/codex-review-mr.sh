# Codex merge-request review — an independent model reviews a branch before it merges.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Governance rule 2: anything touching auth, spend, the
# resolver or the ledger's arithmetic is reviewed by a DIFFERENT model before
# it counts as done. Self-review does not catch self-inflicted defects — on
# 2026-08-01 four vulnerabilities reached production and two of them were
# introduced by the fixes for the other two, written and reviewed by the same
# model, which passed its own work every time.
#
# This script encodes the invocation and brief shape that actually complete.
# Each part below cost real time to learn; none of it is decoration.
#
#   usage:
#     scripts/codex-review-mr.sh                      # review HEAD vs main
#     scripts/codex-review-mr.sh feat/my-branch       # review a branch vs main
#     scripts/codex-review-mr.sh feat/my-branch api/x.ts   # review ONE file
#
# Output lands in .codex-reviews/<branch>/ — one brief + one review per file,
# plus VERDICTS.md. That directory is gitignored: reviews are evidence for the
# author, not repo content.

Skills WAIVED by your human partner. Do not read any SKILL.md.

Read ONE file: $ABS
Read nothing else unless a single import is strictly required to settle a question.
Do not modify anything. Do not run tests.

You are reviewing a change before it merges. The author wrote it; you are a
different model, and your job is to REFUTE it, not to summarise it. Assume the
change is wrong until the code shows otherwise.

WHAT THE AUTHOR SAYS THIS CHANGE DOES:
$SUBJECT

THE DIFF (truncated at 400 lines if longer):
$DIFF

REPO INVARIANTS a change here must not break:
- A guard must DERIVE its scope from the property itself, never enumerate a
  list of known cases. A check satisfiable by a list is already out of date.
- Published counts must never equal a query's page size.
- The call ledger's base_rate must never absorb a forecast signal.
- resolve-calls must never read probability; it reads only frozen criterion columns.
- Public renderers read colour from src/styles/email-tokens.ts. No hex literals.
- A check whose result does not gate an action is a log line, not a check.

ANSWER EXACTLY TWO QUESTIONS. State CONFIRMED or REFUTED, then 3-6 sentences
citing line numbers.

Q1. HYPOTHESIS: this change does what its commit message claims, and does ONLY
that. Confirm or refute. Name any behaviour it changes that the message does
not mention, any case it silently stops handling, and any caller it breaks.

Q2. HYPOTHESIS: this change introduces no regression and violates none of the
invariants above. Confirm or refute. If it adds or edits a guard, state
specifically whether that guard DERIVES its scope or ENUMERATES it, and whether
a NEW instance of the guarded thing would fail by default or pass by omission.

OUTPUT FORMAT, nothing else:
Q1: CONFIRMED|REFUTED — <3-6 sentences>
Q2: CONFIRMED|REFUTED — <3-6 sentences>
BLOCKER: <the one thing that should stop this merging, or "none">
